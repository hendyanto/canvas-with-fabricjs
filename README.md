Made for programming lesson for primary schoolers.

This is a canvas implementation using fabric.js, to create rectangles and lines inside the canvas easily.

Trying to make sure it is easy for them to understand codes from basics, by:

- Using easy languages
- Minimalizing setups
- Using canvas so it is more interesting for the childrens

## **Usage** ##

`var one = new createNewRectangle('red');`

### available movements ###

```javascript
one.moveDown();
one.moveUp();
one.moveRight();
one.moveLeft();
```
